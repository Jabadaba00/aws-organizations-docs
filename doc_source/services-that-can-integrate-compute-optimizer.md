# AWS Compute Optimizer and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-compute-optimizer"></a>

AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS resources\. Resource examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances and Auto Scaling groups\. Compute Optimizer reports whether your resources are optimal and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads\. For more information about Compute Optimizer, see the [AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/what-is.html)\.

Use the following information to help you to help you integrate AWS Compute Optimizer with AWS Organizations\.



## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-compute-optimizer"></a>

The following [service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) is automatically created in your organization's accounts when you enable trusted access\. These roles allow Compute Optimizer to perform supported operations within the accounts in your organization\.

You can delete or modify these roles only if you disable trusted access between Compute Optimizer and Organizations, or if you remove the member account from the organization\.
+ `AWSServiceRoleForComputeOptimizer`

## Service principals used by the service\-linked roles<a name="integrate-enable-svcprin-compute-optimizer"></a>

The service\-linked roles in the previous section can be assumed only by the service principals authorized by the trust relationships defined for the role\. The service\-linked roles used by Compute Optimizer grant access to the following service principals:
+ `compute-optimizer.amazonaws.com`

## Enabling trusted access with Compute Optimizer<a name="integrate-enable-ta-compute-optimizer"></a>

For information about the permissions needed to enable trusted access, see [Permissions required to enable trusted access](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_trusted_access_perms)\.

You can enable trusted access using either the AWS Compute Optimizer console or the AWS Organizations console\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend that whenever possible, you use the AWS Compute Optimizer console or tools to enable integration with Organizations\. This lets AWS Compute Optimizer perform any configuration that it requires, such as creating resources needed by the service\. Proceed with these steps only if you can’t enable integration using the tools provided by AWS Compute Optimizer\.For more information, see [this note](orgs_integrate_services.md#important-note-about-integration)\.   
If you enable trusted access by using the AWS Compute Optimizer console or tools then you don’t need to complete these steps\.

**To enable trusted access using the Compute Optimizer console**  
You must sign in to the Compute Optimizer console using your organization's management account\. Opt\-in on behalf of your organization by following the instructions at [Opting in your Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/getting-started.html#account-opt-in) in the *AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide*\.

You can enable trusted access by using either the AWS Organizations console, by running a AWS CLI command, or by calling an API operation in one of the AWS SDKs\.

#### [ Old console ]

**To enable trusted service access using the Organizations console**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\. 

1. On the **[Settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/home#/organization/settings)** tab under **Trusted access for AWS services**, find the row for **AWS Compute Optimizer**, and then choose **Enable trusted access**\.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, choose **Enable access for *service\-name***\.

1. If you are the administrator of only AWS Organizations, tell the administrator of AWS Compute Optimizer that they can now enable that service using its console to work with AWS Organizations\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To enable trusted service access using the Organizations console**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\. 

1. On the **[Services](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/services)** page, find the row for **AWS Compute Optimizer**, choose the service’s name, and then choose **Enable trusted access**\.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, enable **Show the option to enable trusted access**, enter **enable** in the box, and then choose **Enable trusted access**\.

1. If you are the administrator of only AWS Organizations, tell the administrator of AWS Compute Optimizer that they can now enable that service using its console to work with AWS Organizations\.

#### [ AWS CLI, AWS API ]

**To enable trusted service access using the OrganizationsCLI/SDK**  
You can use the following AWS CLI commands or API operations to enable trusted service access:
+ AWS CLI: [aws organizations enable\-aws\-service\-access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/enable-aws-service-access.html)

  You can run the following command to enable AWS Compute Optimizer as a trusted service with Organizations\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations enable-aws-service-access \ 
      --service-principal compute-optimizer.amazonaws.com
  ```

  This command produces no output when successful\.
