# AWS Firewall Manager and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-fms"></a>

AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that centrally configures and manages firewall rules for web applications across your accounts and applications\. Using AWS Firewall Manager, you can roll out AWS WAF rules all at once for your Application Load Balancers and Amazon CloudFront distributions across all of the accounts in your AWS organization\. Use AWS Firewall Manager to set up your firewall rules just once and have them automatically applied across all accounts and resources within your organization, even as new resources and accounts are added\. 

**Note**  
Although Firewall Manager doesn't use an Organizations delegated administrator, it does have its own ability to delegate another account as administrator of the Firewall Manager service in the accounts in your organization\. For more information, see [Set the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-integration.html)

For more information about AWS Firewall Manager, see the [AWS Firewall Manager Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/fms-chapter.html)\.

Use the following information to help you to help you integrate AWS Firewall Manager with AWS Organizations\.



## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-fms"></a>

The following [service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) is automatically created in your organization's accounts when you enable trusted access\. These roles allow Firewall Manager to perform supported operations within the accounts in your organization\.

You can delete or modify these roles only if you disable trusted access between Firewall Manager and Organizations, or if you remove the member account from the organization\.
+ `AWSServiceRoleForFMS`

## Service principals used by the service\-linked roles<a name="integrate-enable-svcprin-fms"></a>

The service\-linked roles in the previous section can be assumed only by the service principals authorized by the trust relationships defined for the role\. The service\-linked roles used by Firewall Manager grant access to the following service principals:
+ `fms.amazonaws.com`

## Enabling trusted access with Firewall Manager<a name="integrate-enable-ta-fms"></a>

For information about the permissions needed to enable trusted access, see [Permissions required to enable trusted access](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_trusted_access_perms)\.

You can enable trusted access using either the AWS Firewall Manager console or the AWS Organizations console\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend that whenever possible, you use the AWS Firewall Manager console or tools to enable integration with Organizations\. This lets AWS Firewall Manager perform any configuration that it requires, such as creating resources needed by the service\. Proceed with these steps only if you can’t enable integration using the tools provided by AWS Firewall Manager\.For more information, see [this note](orgs_integrate_services.md#important-note-about-integration)\.   
If you enable trusted access by using the AWS Firewall Manager console or tools then you don’t need to complete these steps\.

You must sign in with your AWS Organizations management account and configure an account within the organization as the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account\. For more information, see [Step 2: Set the AWS Firewall Manager Administrator Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-integration.html) in the *AWS Firewall Manager Developer Guide*\.

You can enable trusted access by using either the AWS Organizations console, by running a AWS CLI command, or by calling an API operation in one of the AWS SDKs\.
